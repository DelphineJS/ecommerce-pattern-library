header-image:
  desc: |
    - Header images are to be used as an accent for forms or pages with no other images.
    - They have the same dimensions as ad banners, without any text.
    - They should not touch the element above them. They always touch the outside edge of the element below them. Their width is also capped at larger screen sizes.
product-array:
  desc: |
    - Product arrays are only seen on product detail pages. There should only be one per page.
    - Product arrays show one main product shot, with 3 smaller detail shots below.
    - They should always be used alongside the product title and information.
social-photo-array:
  desc: |
    - Social photo arrays are used in footer sections. They display a grid of images pulled from the brand's social media accounts.
    - Each photo links to a hashtag on Black Stag's social media.
    - Social photo arrays should always have their own title to avoid confusion with banners and cards.

Images show shots of the product and relevant scenes that echo the brand's aesthetic. The images used throughout Black Stag's website are all desaturated, dark, and moody. If the product is not shown, the image should be of nature, specifically Northern woods.
