- Tables are used only on the checkout page to let the user know of all the details of their order. The order summary breaks down all pricing and gives the user an order total once they have entered their shipping and payment details.
- This type of table should never span the full width of the page. They should only ever exist in a grid, taking up a third of the grid width at most.
