breadcrumbs:
  desc: |
    - Breadcrumbs show the user where they are on the inner pages of the website. They are only seen on product pages, and do not appear on main pages such as the home page or the cart.
    - Breadcrumbs show a series of links to bring you to the place you have just come from.
side-navigation:
  desc: |
    - The side navigation is only seen on product overview pages where multiple products are displayed.
    - It should only take up 1/4 of the main grid, and should always be seen alongside product. It should never be the only thing on a line.
    - The side navigation is not shown on mobile sizes. It appears only at large screen sizes when the width of the page allows it.

Navigations act as pathways to different pages on the website. You should be able to use the navigation to reach your destination or filter content.
