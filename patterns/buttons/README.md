The buttons use our accent colour to draw attention to the link. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The regular buttons are for forms and where the background is a light colour. They are not for use on images.
- The light buttons are for cards and dark background areas. They are not for use on images.
- The regular ghost buttons are for button lists and on banners with light images.
- The light ghost buttons are for use on banners with dark images.

These buttons can be mixed with the `font-size` classes to vary their size.
